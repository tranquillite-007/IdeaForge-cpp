# IdeaForge

**IdeaForge** is a C++ program designed to ignite creativity and inspire innovation for game developers, writers, and artists. By generating random words based on user-selected categories, IdeaForge serves as a powerful brainstorming tool that helps users overcome creative blocks and explore new ideas.

## Purpose

In the creative process, generating fresh ideas can often be a daunting task. IdeaForge addresses this challenge by providing a dynamic platform that allows users to select from various categories, including environments, characters, objects, themes, platforms, emotions/moods, art styles, and physics. The program then generates random words from these categories, serving as prompts for new projects.

- Encourages creative thinking and idea exploration
- Useful for game development, writing, and artistic projects
